# Land Surface Temperature Evaluation from Satellite Data
This repository contains the solution proposed for the second Mini-Contest of the Data Mining course of University of Naples Federico II.

The aim of the contest is to determine the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite data, using data coming from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-8 missions.
